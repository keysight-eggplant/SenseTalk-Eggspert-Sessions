Join Eggplant Research and Developer, Doug Simons, to learn more about case sensitivity within SenseTalk.

SenseTalk is fundamentally a case-insensitive language, meaning all keywords and variable names are all case-insensitive. This allows people to be casual in their use of capitalization without any change of behavior.

### Topics
- property keys are case-sensitive
- setting `the caseSensitive` global property
- considering or ignoring case for each operator
